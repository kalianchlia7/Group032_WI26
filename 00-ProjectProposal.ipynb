    "Coral reefs are highly sensitive marine ecosystems that provide important ecological, economic, and coastal protection benefits. In recent years, coral reef health has declined worldwide due to rising sea surface temperatures, more frequent marine heatwaves, and local stressors such as algal overgrowth. Thermal stress, often measured using Degree Heating Weeks (DHW), is strongly linked to coral bleaching events, which can lead to partial or complete loss of live coral cover. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) While many studies document coral decline following thermal stress, less is known about how coral reefs recover over time and weather recovery follows consistent patterns across different sites.  <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Being students of University of California, San Diego, part of our academic environment is ingrained with the university’s strengths in marine biology, oceanography, and climate science through programs such as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. UC San Diego researchers have made major contributions to coral reef monitoring and the study of climate-driven marine stressors, which does add to the motivation for this project. Publicly available datasets from organizations like NOAA and the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program align well with UC San Diego’s emphasis on data-driven marine science and provide a strong foundation for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has shown that coral recovery trajectories can vary widely depending on environmental conditions and local ecological dynamics. Studies using NOAA Coral Reef Watch data have found that higher DHW values are associated with more severe bleaching and increased coral mortality, often resulting in slow or incomplete recovery. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) However, more recent monitoring efforts, such as the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP), provide long-term, site-level data on percent live coral and algal cover across U.S. reef systems. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the many studies using this data focus on overall trends in reef health, fewer explicitly examine differences in recovery pathways over time. Our project builds on this prior work by identifying coral recovery trajectories and analyzing how thermal stress and algal cover, both individually and together, are associated with differences in recovery outcomes across U.S. coral reef sites.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that coral reef sites exposed to higher cumulative thermal stress will exhibit recovery trajectories characterized by slower increases or sustained declines in percent live coral cover. Higher cumulative thermal stress is strongly associated with coral bleaching, reduced repoduction, and decline in health, which can all prevent reef recovery. We also predict that sites with higher algal cover will show poorer recovery outcomes. Elevated algal cover often follows coral loss and can also prove to be detrimental to coral by competing for space and changing the conditions in the area."
