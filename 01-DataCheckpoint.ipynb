Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
    "5. Feel free to add more cells here if that's helpful for you\n"

    "\n",
    "The dataset includes 26,325 observations and 7 variables. Important variables for our analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PRIMARY_SAMPLE_UNIT: Unique reef site identifier\n",
    "* LATITUDE and LONGITUDE: Geographic coordinates used to locate sites\n",
    "* YEAR: Survey year\n",

    "* COVER_CAT_NAME: Habitat category (e.g., coral, algae)\n",
    "* HARDBOTTOM_P: Percent cover value for hardbottom habitats\n",
    "\n",
    "These measurements matter because they describe relative dominance rather than exact quantities. A percent value does not tell us the total amount of coral or algae in an absolute sense,but it shows how much space each category occupies compared to others at that site and year. Looking at these values across multiple years helps reveal patterns of change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations to consider:  The monitoring sites were not selected randomly; they reflect locations that are accessible to researchers or part of established survey programs. As a result, some regions may be sampled more frequently than others. Because benthic cover is visually estimated by divers, environmental conditions and observer judgment can introduce some variability. The dataset also required minor cleaning before analysis, such as removing non-data rows. Even with these limitations, the dataset provides structured, site-specific information that allows for meaningful comparisons across space and time.,"
