Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project does not involve human subjects or individual-level data. All datasets used are publicly available environmental monitoring datasets collected by government agencies (e.g., NOAA) using standardized ecological survey methods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Collection bias is relevant because coral reef monitoring sites are not evenly distributed across regions or reef types. Some U.S. reef systems may be monitored more frequently or consistently than others due to accessibility, funding, or conservation priority. This could bias observed recovery pathways toward better-studied regions. We acknowledge this limitation and will avoid overgeneralizing results beyond the monitored sites.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project does not collect or use any personally identifiable information. All data are ecological and site-level, such as percent coral cover and thermal stress metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because this project does not involve human populations or protected groups, downstream bias related to demographic characteristics is not applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets used are publicly available and contain no sensitive information. Data will be stored locally for analysis using standard file protections. While advanced security measures are not required, care will be taken to avoid accidental modification or loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The project does not use personal or individual-level data. There are no individuals whose data could be removed upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Data will be retained only for the duration of the course project and may be deleted afterward. Since the data are publicly available, long-term storage does not pose ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis does not include input from reef managers or local communities. Our findings *could* influence policy or funding, e.g., reefs with faster recovery might get more attention, while slower-recovering reefs could be deprioritized. We will clarify that recovery trajectories are descriptive, not value judgments.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Potential sources of bias include uneven temporal coverage across sites, missing years of data, and unmeasured confounding factors such as storms, pollution, or local management practices. These limitations may affect interpretation of recovery trajectories and will be discussed when presenting results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Visualizations and summary statistics will be designed to accurately reflect the underlying data, including showing uncertainty, missing data, and variability across sites. We will avoid visual choices that exaggerate trends or imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No data with personally identifiable information will be used or displayed, as all data are ecological and environmental in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data cleaning, merging, and analysis process will be documented using reproducible code and clear descriptions of methods. This allows the analysis to be reviewed or revisited if issues are discovered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project does not involve predictive models that affect individuals, nor does it include demographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fairness across human groups is not applicable. However, we recognize that modeling choices may implicitly emphasize certain regions or reef types over others due to data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Recovery metrics such as changes in percent live coral cover or trajectory slopes were chosen because they are commonly used in reef ecology. We acknowledge that no single metric fully captures reef health and will discuss this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analytical methods used are interpretable and can be explained in clear terms. We will avoid complex models that obscure interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Limitations such as observational data, lack of causal inference, and incomplete coverage will be clearly communicated in the final report to avoid misinterpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project is exploratory and academic in nature and will not be deployed in a production environment. Ongoing monitoring is therefore not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because this analysis does not produce decisions affecting individuals or communities directly, formal redress mechanisms are not required. However, we aim to present findings responsibly to avoid misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is no deployed system or model to roll back. If errors are discovered, analyses and conclusions can be revised.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While the project is academic, results could potentially be misused if interpreted as causal or definitive. To mitigate this, we will clearly state the scope, assumptions, and limitations of the analysis.\n"
