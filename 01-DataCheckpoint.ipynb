    "Coral reefs are highly sensitive marine ecosystems that provide important ecological, economic, and coastal protection benefits. In recent years, coral reef health has declined worldwide due to rising sea surface temperatures, more frequent marine heatwaves, and local stressors such as algal overgrowth. Thermal stress, often measured using Degree Heating Weeks (DHW), is strongly linked to coral bleaching events, which can lead to partial or complete loss of live coral cover. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) While many studies document coral decline following thermal stress, less is known about how coral reefs recover over time and weather recovery follows consistent patterns across different sites.  <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Being students of University of California, San Diego, part of our academic environment is ingrained with the university’s strengths in marine biology, oceanography, and climate science through programs such as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. UC San Diego researchers have made major contributions to coral reef monitoring and the study of climate-driven marine stressors, which does add to the motivation for this project. Publicly available datasets from organizations like NOAA and the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program align well with UC San Diego’s emphasis on data-driven marine science and provide a strong foundation for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has shown that coral recovery trajectories can vary widely depending on environmental conditions and local ecological dynamics. Studies using NOAA Coral Reef Watch data have found that higher DHW values are associated with more severe bleaching and increased coral mortality, often resulting in slow or incomplete recovery. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) However, more recent monitoring efforts, such as the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP), provide long-term, site-level data on percent live coral and algal cover across U.S. reef systems. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "While many studies using these data focus on overall trends in reef health, fewer explicitly examine differences in recovery pathways over time. Our project builds on this prior work by identifying coral recovery trajectories and analyzing how thermal stress and algal cover, both individually and together, are associated with differences in recovery outcomes across U.S. coral reef sites.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that coral reef sites exposed to higher cumulative thermal stress will exhibit recovery trajectories characterized by slower increases or sustained declines in percent live coral cover. Higher cumulative thermal stress is strongly associated with coral bleaching, reduced repoduction, and decline in health, which can all prevent reef recovery. We also predict that sites with higher algal cover will show poorer recovery outcomes. Elevated algal cover often follows coral loss and can also prove to be detrimental to coral by competing for space and changing the conditions in the area."

    "### Puerto Rico Coral Reef Benthic Cover (CRCP Monitoring Data, 2014–2023)\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The Puerto Rico Benthic Cover dataset includes 10,656 reef survey observations collected between 2014 and 2023 through NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation Program. Each row represents one benthic category (like live coral or algae) measured at a specific reef site on a particular survey date. The dataset includes the site ID (`PRIMARY_SAMPLE_UNIT`), latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees), survey year (and month/day when available), region, the organism category (`COVER_CAT_NAME`), and the percent of hardbottom covered (`HARDBOTTOM_P`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main variable we care about is percent hardbottom cover, which is measured in percent (%). This tells us how much of the reef surface is covered by a certain organism type. For example, 30% live coral cover means that about one-third of the surveyed reef area was covered by living coral. In many reef systems, coral cover above about 30% is considered relatively healthy, while values below 10% often suggest significant degradation or limited recovery after stress events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our research question looks at recovery patterns in live coral cover and how those patterns relate to algal cover, we use COVER_CAT_NAME to separate coral from algae and HARDBOTTOM_P to measure how dominant each group is. By combining location (site and region) with time (year), we can track how coral cover changes over time at different sites and see whether some reefs recover differently than others. This helps us explore whether higher algal cover is associated with weaker coral recovery after stress events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables We're Focusing On**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we’re mainly looking at location and habitat structure variables from the benthic dataset.\n",
    "* Site ID (`PRIMARY_SAMPLE_UNIT`)\n",
    "This is the unique identifier for each survey site. It allows us to group observations by location and track changes over time at the same site\n",
    "* Latitude (degrees north) and Longitude (degrees east)\n",
    "These tell us where each survey site is located. We’ll use them to look at spatial patterns and see whether habitat characteristics cluster in certain areas.\n",
    "* Date (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`)\n",
    "These variables describe when the observation was recorded. YEAR allows us to evaluate long-term trends, while month/day could help identify seasonal patterns.\n",
    "* Region \n",
    "This categorizes sites into broader geographic areas within Puerto Rico. It allows us to compare coral and algae cover across different parts of the island.\n",
    "* `COVER_CAT_NAME`\n",
    "This identifies the organism category being measured (e.g., coral, algae). This is central to our research question because we are specifically comparing coral vs. algae cover.\n",
    "* Percent Cover (`HARDBOTTOM_P`)\n",
    "This is the key outcome variable. It represents the percentage of hardbottom substrate covered by the organism listed in `COVER_CAT_NAME`.\n",
    "It is measured as a percent (%), ranging theoretically from 0 to 100.\n",
    "> * Values near 0% indicate little to no coverage.\n",
    "> * Values near 100% indicate nearly complete coverage of the hardbottom area by that organism type.\n",
    "> * Values outside 0–100% would be biologically impossible and indicate data issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining site location (latitude and longitude), region, time (year, month, day), organism category (coral vs. algae), and percent hardbottom cover, we can analyze how benthic community composition varies across Puerto Rico and over time. These variables allow us to examine both spatial differences between regions and temporal trends within sites. Rather than simply describing individual survey locations, this approach helps us identify broader patterns in coral and algae cover and assess how benthic communities may be shifting across space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concerns and Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "One major concern is sampling bias. Survey sites are not randomly distributed across all reef habitat — they are likely chosen based on accessibility, monitoring priorities, or ecological importance. This means results may not represent all reef areas equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is temporal imbalance. Some sites may have been surveyed more frequently than others, and some years may have more complete coverage than others. This could affect trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, several numeric variables (like latitude, depth, and percent cover values) are stored as text and need to be converted before analysis. The first row of the dataset also contains unit labels instead of real data and must be removed during cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dataset only covers about 10 years (2014–2023), not the full 20-year period in our research question. While it still captures recent bleaching and stress events, longer-term trends would require additional historical data.\n"

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project does not involve human subjects or individual-level data. All datasets used are publicly available environmental monitoring datasets collected by government agencies (e.g., NOAA) using standardized ecological survey methods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Collection bias is relevant because coral reef monitoring sites are not evenly distributed across regions or reef types. Some U.S. reef systems may be monitored more frequently or consistently than others due to accessibility, funding, or conservation priority. This could bias observed recovery pathways toward better-studied regions. We acknowledge this limitation and will avoid overgeneralizing results beyond the monitored sites.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project does not collect or use any personally identifiable information. All data are ecological and site-level, such as percent coral cover and thermal stress metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because this project does not involve human populations or protected groups, downstream bias related to demographic characteristics is not applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets used are publicly available and contain no sensitive information. Data will be stored locally for analysis using standard file protections. While advanced security measures are not required, care will be taken to avoid accidental modification or loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The project does not use personal or individual-level data. There are no individuals whose data could be removed upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> Data will be retained only for the duration of the course project and may be deleted afterward. Since the data are publicly available, long-term storage does not pose ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis does not include input from reef managers or local communities. Our findings *could* influence policy or funding, e.g., reefs with faster recovery might get more attention, while slower-recovering reefs could be deprioritized. We will clarify that recovery trajectories are descriptive, not value judgments.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Potential sources of bias include uneven temporal coverage across sites, missing years of data, and unmeasured confounding factors such as storms, pollution, or local management practices. These limitations may affect interpretation of recovery trajectories and will be discussed when presenting results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Visualizations and summary statistics will be designed to accurately reflect the underlying data, including showing uncertainty, missing data, and variability across sites. We will avoid visual choices that exaggerate trends or imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No data with personally identifiable information will be used or displayed, as all data are ecological and environmental in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data cleaning, merging, and analysis process will be documented using reproducible code and clear descriptions of methods. This allows the analysis to be reviewed or revisited if issues are discovered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project does not involve predictive models that affect individuals, nor does it include demographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fairness across human groups is not applicable. However, we recognize that modeling choices may implicitly emphasize certain regions or reef types over others due to data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Recovery metrics such as changes in percent live coral cover or trajectory slopes were chosen because they are commonly used in reef ecology. We acknowledge that no single metric fully captures reef health and will discuss this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analytical methods used are interpretable and can be explained in clear terms. We will avoid complex models that obscure interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Limitations such as observational data, lack of causal inference, and incomplete coverage will be clearly communicated in the final report to avoid misinterpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project is exploratory and academic in nature and will not be deployed in a production environment. Ongoing monitoring is therefore not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because this analysis does not produce decisions affecting individuals or communities directly, formal redress mechanisms are not required. However, we aim to present findings responsibly to avoid misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is no deployed system or model to roll back. If errors are discovered, analyses and conclusions can be revised.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While the project is academic, results could potentially be misused if interpreted as causal or definitive. To mitigate this, we will clearly state the scope, assumptions, and limitations of the analysis.\n"
